# Faculty Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. Missing Faculty Data Properties
**Problem**: The `FacultyProfile` component was trying to access `facultyData.subjects` and `facultyData.classes` properties that didn't exist in the mock data.

**Fix**: Added the missing properties to the `facultyData` object in `ModernFacultyDashboard.tsx`:
```javascript
subjects: ['Data Structures', 'Database Systems', 'Software Engineering'],
classes: ['CSE-3A', 'CSE-3B', 'CSE-2A'],
```

### 2. Missing Theme Class
**Problem**: The faculty dashboard wasn't applying the proper role-based styling.

**Fix**: Added the `theme-faculty` class to the main container div to enable proper CSS theming.

### 3. Missing Faculty Modules
**Problem**: Only the dashboard module was working because other modules weren't properly integrated into the navigation and routing system.

**Fix**: Added the missing modules to the sidebar and routing:
- Attendance Management
- Timetable
- Exams & Grades  
- ID Card

### 4. Property Name Mismatch
**Problem**: The `FacultyIdCard` component was using `facultyData.employeeId` but the data object used `facultyData.facultyId`.

**Fix**: Updated all references from `employeeId` to `facultyId` in the FacultyIdCard component.

### 5. Missing Component Imports
**Problem**: The new faculty modules weren't imported in the main dashboard file.

**Fix**: Added imports for:
- FacultyAttendance
- FacultyTimetable  
- FacultyExams
- FacultyIdCard
